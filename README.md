diamond
=======

The Diamond Kata is a coding problem to produce a diamond of letters up to a given letter. For example the 'A' diamond is

	A

while the B diamond is

	 A
	B B
	 A

and the C diamond is

	  A
	 B B
	C   C
	 B B
	  A

See http://blog.gdinwiddie.com/2014/11/30/another-approach-to-the-diamond-kata/ for a discussion of this code, and the context in which it was written.
